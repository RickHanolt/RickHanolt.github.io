When I began the learn.co front end web developer bootcamp, I knew that it would take discipline. I currently have a full time job among other responsibilities and so to make this work I decided from the start that I would need to set time aside that would be just for coding. The problem may have been that the time I decided to "set aside" started out as about 4-6 hours each night when I got home from work and then another 8-10 hours on weekend days that I didn't work my normal job in a chemistry lab. 

I was passionate about learning to code before I started and I was under the impression that passion alone would be enough to get me to the finish line in this particular pursuit. However, a couple months in I feel like I've already been derailed for the first time by other responsibilities getting in the way of my coding time. 

A big part of the issue seems (at least to me) that I may have been a bit unrealistic in my goals for how much time I would spend working on coding each week. Being passionate about something is one thing, but completely immersing yourself in it and not allowing oneself any time for any other pursuits is an other entirely. 


I have revisited some of the goals I set at the beginning of this bootcamp and I've made some slight adjustments. Finishing is the goal and if I have to pull back on my aggressive timeline for finishing, it'll be worth it in the end if it helps me complete the bootcamp in a way that allows me to maintain some work/life balance. I feel that in the end more realistic goals and pacing will help me learn the material better and be more successful as a front end web developer in the long run.
